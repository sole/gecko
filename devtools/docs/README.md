# Firefox Developer Tools

**Hello!**

This documentation is for people who want to work on the developer tools that are shipped with Firefox. [Get started here](./getting-started/).

If you are looking for help with using the tools, check out [the end user documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools) instead.

Happy developing!
